You start with a Pizza model:


model Pizza {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
}
You run:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init
✅ It creates a table in the database.

Later, you add a new field:


  price Float
You run:
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-price
✅ It updates the table in the database (adds the price column).


First you created the table (init)

Then you added the price column (add-price)

So it becomes a version history of your DB schema — very useful for team projects and large applications!
